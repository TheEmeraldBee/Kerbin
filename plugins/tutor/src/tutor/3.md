# Moving Faster!

We know how to move character by character and line by line, but that's slow!
Let's learn how to jump around the file much faster.

## Word Movement
You can move by words using `w` (next word start), `e` (next word end), and `b` (previous word start).
Try using `w` to move quickly through this sentence.

## Line Movement
To jump to the start of the line, press `0`. To jump to the end, press `$`.
This is very useful for quickly navigating long lines of code!

## File Movement
If you want to go to the very top of the file, press `gg`.
To go to the very bottom, press `shift-g` (or `G`).

## Test: Navigation
Use your new navigation skills to fix these sentences.
Tip: Use `w` to jump to words, `x` to delete errors, and `i` to insert corrections.

[The qwik brown fox] <!-- Expect: "The quick brown fox" -->
[Jumps over the lazy doggy] <!-- Expect: "Jumps over the lazy dog" -->
