# Visual Mode

Visual mode allows you to select a range of text to operate on.

## Entering Visual Mode
Press `v` to enter Visual mode. You'll see `SELECT` in the mode indicator.
Move your cursor using movement keys (`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `w`, etc.) to expand the selection.

## Line Selection
If you are already in Visual mode, you can press `v` again to quickly select the entire current line.

## Operating on Selections
Once you have selected text, you can:
- Press `x` to delete the selected text.
- Press `esc` to cancel the selection and return to Normal mode.

## Test: Visual Selection
Use Visual mode to select and delete the text inside the brackets, but keep the brackets!
Hint: Place cursor on the first letter, press `v`, move to the last letter, then press `d`.

[Delete this text completely] <!-- Expect: "" -->
[   Remove this too   ] <!-- Expect: "" -->
