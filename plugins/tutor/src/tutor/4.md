# Intermediate Editing

Sometimes you need to add or remove entire lines of text, or fix a mistake.

## Inserting Lines
Instead of moving to the end of a line and pressing `enter`, you can use `o`.
`o` will create a new line *below* the cursor and enter Insert mode.
`shift-o` (or `O`) will create a new line *above* the cursor and enter Insert mode.

## Deleting Lines
To delete the entire line you are currently on, simply press `dd`.

## Undo and Redo
Made a mistake? No problem!
Press `u` to **Undo** your last change.
If you undid too much, press `shift-u` (or `U`) to **Redo**.

## Understood!
Type `I Understand` into the box below to show you know how this works
Feel free to mess around as much as you want to in this file!
