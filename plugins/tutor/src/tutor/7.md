# Command Bar!
Well Done User! Now lets learn how all of these keybindings were created!

Make sure you're in basic `NORMAL` mode for this.

Now press `:` this should show a menu! Now you can type things in and get help, descriptions, and even some autocompletions!

Lets do something real simple: type `rx` into the bar, followed by a quoted string.
Now type what is in the brackets below, then press enter. You should see the text selected. Finally press `x`

[hello, world] <!-- Expect: "" -->

Well done, you've just used regex to select text, then delete it!

Now for something else, instead of inserting text the normal way, use `:insert "hello, world"` while in `NORMAL` mode inside of the brackets 

[] <!-- Expect: "hello, world" -->

Pretty cool, right? If you want to learn more about what commands are and how they work, look into the default configuration you're supplied with in your config directory!

Well, this is it for the tutor plugin. Enter into the bar `:o %cfg_folder/src/lib.rs`, then follow the comments in order to remove the plugin from your system
