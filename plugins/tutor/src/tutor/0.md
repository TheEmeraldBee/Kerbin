# Welcome to Kerbin, your Space-Age Text Editor!
This is the Kerbin Tutor plugin, it's going to guide you through how to get used to using kerbin with the default bindings :)

Let's start with movement, you can use either `hjkl` to move around, or `up, down, left, right`
I highly recommended to learn to use the `hjkl` bindings as they will end up being much more comfortable most of the time.

When messing inside of the tutor, feel free to edit text, just don't remove the brackets or html comments,
this will make it hard to know what to do to move onto the next step

Now for editing text. This editor uses a system I like to call a `mode stack`
This is a way for the editor to compose keybindings quickly and simply

In order to change the mode, we can run commands that push modes or pop modes from the stack.
By default this editor uses `esc` as a keybinding that will always pop 1 mode from the stack.

Now that we have an ok idea of how the stack works, put your cursor on the `]` on the bottom line of the file and then press `i`
This will change your mode into insert mode. This mode will add text when pressing keys. You'll notice in the bottom left that you can see
`NORMAL` -> `INSERT`. This is how you know that your mode stack contains the normal mode, **THEN** the insert mode.

Let's insert the text `hello, world` into the brackets below, this will move you onto the next step. Good Luck!

[] <!-- Expect: "hello, world" -->
