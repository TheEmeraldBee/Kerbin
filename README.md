# Kerbin

Kerbin is a powerful, extensible editor inspired by
[Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) and [Neovim](https://neovim.io/).
Built for ease of use, while keeping powerusers
in good hands with plugins and configurations
that could rival those of neovim.

Check back in a bit for full demonstrations
when the editor is more fleshed out (around mid October).

# üí° Concepts üí°

## Core Concepts
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) based plugin system
    - Install plugins using `cargo`
    - Write plugins using pure rust
    - Configuration can be used with rust when toml doesn't work (complicated systems)
- [Toml](https://toml.io/en/) based configuration
    - Programming languages aren't the best way of writing
    - Toml is an incredible configuration language for most use cases
        - The remaining can be part of a plugin's init function
- Flexible Bindings
    - Kerbin's goal is to be usable by anyone, Vim, Kakoune, Emacs, Visual, etc.
    Allowing anyone to use the plugin ecosystem, no matter they're keybindings!
    - Allows for anyone to use kerbin, without worrying about necissarily relearning how
    they write code
- [TreeSitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) and [Lsp](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) Drives Modern Editing
    - Kerbin is fully on board with tree-sitter and lsps being the future.
    - Many people will need tree-sitter and lsps to work with code (me included), but some won't.
    For This reason, lsp and tree-sitter are plugins maintained within the core editor, but aren't used
    unless defined within the rust plugins. Though the default configuration uses these plugins, people
    can remove them without losing too much functionality.

## Unique Concepts
- Stack based modal editing
    - Although I haven't seen this within any other editor, I find it very intuitive. It allows for any version of modal editing by defining a
    mode stack. This mode stack allows for many modes to be active at once, for example, `NORMAL -> CURSOR -> INSERT` within the default bindings,
    defines that we are in a base mode of NORMAL, then we are in Multicursor mode, which prefixes commands with an `aa` command (apply next command to all cursors),
    that finally, within the insert command writes the text to all of the cursors at the same time
    - This allows for drastically simpler bindings for many shared binding types, as well as allowing users to create even more powerful editing systems quickly without
    sacrificing time to write out the same bindings over and over again.
- Kitty Terminal Support
    - I personally love what kitty is doing with the terminal, making it more accessible to everyone, and making leaving the terminal less and less necissary.
    Supporting the rendering protocols is a big part of making the core experience good, as allowing for things like image and markdown rendering is pretty awesome.
    - This however should never be forced. Although this will be within the core rendering engine, all functionality will only be implemented using plugins.

# üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

## Core Development
-   [x] Basic Editor Functionality (insertions, deletions, etc.)
-   [x] Selection Support
-   [x] Multicursor Support
-   [x] TreeSitter Rendering
-   [x] Full Adjustment to using Layouts, then allowing passage of
    specific chunks for rendering. (Chunk system parameters)
-   [x] Plugin Hooks (Replacing rendering systems, Adjusting how
    things render/work, adding new render calls to the statusline, etc.)
-   [x] TreeSitter Indentation Queries

## Documentation & Refinement
- [x] Document core systems and sub modules
- [ ] Go through systems and refactor code
    - Make everything more readable, and stop being afraid of adding more files :)
- [ ] Write out design document
- [ ] Write out main wiki for writing configuration and plugins

## Stability & Enhancements
- [ ] Fix major bugs
- [ ] Implement sending messages to the process using interprocess
  file communication systems
- [ ] Write out CLI systems for handling command-line arguments
  within plugins and handling custom systems
- [ ] Implement Kitty Rendering Protocol Support
    - Most likely within the chunk rendering to support
    Images and Text Scaling (Mainly for markdown)
- [ ] Lsp Support using plugin system
