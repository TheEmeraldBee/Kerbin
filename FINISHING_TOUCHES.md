# General Systems
- [x] Update main CLI side to work better with sending messages
  - Add a query type that can request information from the editor in order to do things :)
    - This will allow for more situations to be handled using just commands (Prevent more rebuilds)
    - This will be explained as being for less direct interactive things (like file trees)
- [ ] Add command to create dialogue with resulting command
  - This is a way for commands to ask for input from a prompt
  - This will make many more things possible, also simplify the UI engine.

  - Should look like `dialogue "o %1" "What File Would You Like To Open?"`
    - This would open a dialogue with the prompt, then run the command with that result
    - This should also allow for multiple dialogues for a command, meaning "o %1 %2 %3" could work, as long as all 3 dialogues are passed
- [x] Create another basic rust command for the installation manager instead of using the current script generated by `claude`
  - Update this to work on any machine
  - This will be what is uploaded to `crates.io`
  - Will manage installation `booster install v0.1.0` `booster install master`, rebuilding `booster rebuild`, quick plugin-adding `booster plug add`
  - Called `booster`
